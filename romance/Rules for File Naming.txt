We can't put commas in Filenames. So:

RULES OF FILE NAMING
(please follow the convention)

[ ] STANDARDIZE Month & Day
    1. YYYY-MM-DD is MOST correct
       i. MM-DD is acceptable. But you only have 1-year.
          Your files will NEVER be organized. They are sorted by alphabetic characters. Integers are first. Years ALWAYS tick up; months revolve every year.
          Do you want 2012-11-11, 2013-11-11, 2013-11-12
             OR
                11-11, 11-11, 11-12
          ?
    2. Let the device CHOOSE THE FILENAME
       i. I swear, they are right. Filenames should be chronological!
       ii. If you get artistic, be right.
       iii. Place ALL YOUR FOOTAGE in 1 folder. ONE.
       iv. Place all your finished projects in ONE FOLDER.
           Nested:
             <MAIN_PROJECTS_DIR>/<MY_PROJECT_FOLDER>
             <MAIN_PROJECTS_DIR>/<MY_PROJECT_FOLDER_2>
             <MAIN_PROJECTS_DIR>/<MY_PROJECT_FOLDER_3>

Now you're ready for War.
